To run the code type: java -jar runCode.jar

You may encounter some errors, here are the walkarounds to such:

1) If you get an error along the lines of "there is no swt-gtk-3740", firstly type "sudo apt-get install libswt-gtk-3-jni libswt-gtk-3-java" then
"sudo cp /usr/lib/jni/libswt-*3740.so ~/.swt/lib/linux/x86_64/".
You need to make sure that you have the libswt-*3740.so files before you copy them into the path.
If you are unable to find the libswt-*3740.so files, go to elwood and type "cd /usr/lib/jni/" and simply copy the *3740 files from here.
Main reason of this error is that the elwood version of the libswt is not the same as the machine trying to run the code.

2) If you get an error saying "Error: Null" and a blank Summary GUI is displayed, then the file is unable to load the matplotlib import.
Simple way to test if this is the case is to run the FinalCode.py i.e python FinalCode.py, and see if the error says unable to import
matplotlib as it does not exist.
To fix this problem simply type "sudo apt-get build-dep python-matplotlib".
